===================

![Wisdom Exchange](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tangentmonger/wisdomexchange/master/img/wisdomexchange.jpg "Wisdom Exchange")

**WRITE YOUR WISDOM**
upon the Page.  Take note: Original wisdom only!  Every one of us
has in his Life uncovered for himself, through joyful or bitter 
experience, a TRUTH to share, be it profound or trifling.
*In case you have Forgotten to Bring a PEN, a PEN has been provided.*

**PRESS BUTTON TO RECEIVE WISDOM**
If no WISDOM is Forthcoming: REJOICE! for you
already know everything you need. 
*If this does not seem to be the case, kindly inform the staff
that the Wisdom Exchange requires maintenance.* 

**GO HENCEFORTH**
with a Spring in your Step, for you are guided by the Advice and 
Knowledge of Kindly Strangers whom you may Never Meet. 
*Unwanted, unheeded and unappreciated Wisdom may be 
deposited in the Bin of Hindsight and Regret.*
